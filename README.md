# Nuxt 3 Demo Products with search

Product Search and Display with SEO params.
I used next tools:
- https://vuestorefront.io/storefront-ui
- https://fakestoreapi.com/
- Nuxt 3 with default configuration

Time spent: 4 hours, I did not have time to implement part of the functions: seo-friendly urls, typing of the whole project.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
npm run dev
```

Have a nice day :)
